A stunning, interactive birthday wish page built with **Next.js 15**. This application generates a personalized birthday greeting based on the URL, delivering a unique experience for every user.

## ✨ Key Feature: Dynamic Personalization

The core feature of this app is its ability to dynamically render a personalized birthday message using the URL path.

**How it works:**
Simply navigate to `/<Name>` to see a custom greeting.
